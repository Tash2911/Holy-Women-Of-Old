    <h1>Women Of Old</h1>
    <p>
      Having to decide which modern women is my role model and inspiration was a
      challenge. Many women are an inspiration to me in different capacities for
      different purposes. I decided to create a website of some women from the
      bible with different situations and circumstances. Going through the bible
      you realise and notice that, there is no new situation or circumstance
      that you may face or may be going through today that people (women) in the
      bible have not yet overcome. You and I need to be encouraged, knowing that
      we can overcome all odds through Christ who strengthens us. Your belief
      system needs to be anchored and founded in a system that is incorruptible,
      unwavering, firm, and consistent. May these few women that I have
      handpicked from the bible be of inspiration and role models to you today
      and always.

              She provides an example of tenacious faith (Read Matthew
              15:22-28). She had extraordinary faith, and a faith like that can
              feel unattainable.

              Married five times, her story demonstrates that Jesus comes even
              to the least of these. He cares for the outcasts of society. Jesus
              saw her need for salvation. Trusting Jesus and experiencing God is
              how we are changed.

              She shows how we can listen to God, even when you are not sure who
              He is yet. She was hospitaple with the little she had. God's
              divine provision can come from the most unlikely sources.
