    <h1>Women Of Old</h1>
    <p>
      Having to decide which modern women is my role model and inspiration was a
      challenge. Many women are an inspiration to me indifferent capacities for
      different purposes. I decided to create a website of some women from the
      bible eith different situations and circumstances. Going through the bible
      you realise that, there is no new situations or circumstances that people
      have not yet overcome. You and i need to be encouraged knowing that we can
      overcome all odds through Christ who strengthens us. Your belief system
      needs to be anchored and founded in a system that is incorruptible,
      unwavering, firm, and consistent.
