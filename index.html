    <h1>Women Of Old</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Having to decide which modern women is my role model and inspiration was a
      challenge. Many women are an inspiration to me in different capacities for
      different purposes. I decided to create a website of some women from the
      bible with different situations and circumstances. Going through the bible
      you realise and notice that, there is no new situation or circumstance
      that you may face or may be going through today that people (women) in the
      bible have not yet overcome. You and I need to be encouraged, knowing that
      we can overcome all odds through Christ who strengthens us. Your belief
      system needs to be anchored and founded in a system that is incorruptible,
      unwavering, firm, and consistent. May these few women that I have
      handpicked from the bible be of inspiration and role models to you today
      and always.

            <p>Briefly yet explicitly, the Canaanite woman presented her plea, she was in dire need of Jesus's mercy. She recognized the authority and diety of Jesus, and that He alone was able to caast out the devil from her daughter.
              She provides an example of tenacious faith . She had extraordinary faith, she was determined not to take NO! for an answer. A faith like that can
              feel unattainable.

            <p> When Jesus found her she was living with a man who was not her husband
              Married five times, her story demonstrates that Jesus comes even
              to the least of these. He cares for the outcasts of society. Jesus
              saw her need for salvation. Trusting Jesus and experiencing God is
              how we are changed.
              <br/> (Read: John 4)

            <p> She feeds Elijah in her home, she was hospitaple with the little she had. She was so sympathetic, kind, and self-sacrificial. Daily she proved that sharing with another needy one did not impoverish her life, but rather greatly enriched it.
              She shows how we can listen to God, even when you are not sure who
              He is yet. God's
              divine provision can come from the most unlikely sources.

        <p>This widow faced the anguish of seeing her sons being taken as slaves in oayment of the debts facing her.When Elisha asked if she owned anything of value, she replied that she had only a pot of oil. Elisha instructed the widow to borrow as many vessels as possible from all her neighbors. The  Lord miraculously provided them with enough oil to sell and pay off the debt.

          <p>Hagar was a slave girl, her mistress (Sarah) was entitled to do as she pleases with her. Sarah decided to use Hagar as a surrogate and eventually regrets. Ishmael and Hagar were banished to the desert, though God promised that Ishmael would raise up a great nation of his own. God does care for us: He heals the broken hearted, gives us an identity and a hope. His promises are true, and He keeps them.

        <p>Ruth was a young widow. She faced a gloomy future without her husband, but she did not seek for self-pity. She remains with her mother-in-law. Ruth was not ashameed of the low order of her work as she took her place as a gleaner with the poor and outcast in the field of Boaz. Ruth represents redemption and hope, as seen in her eventual marriage to Boaz. God hears our cries and He responds.
